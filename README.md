# Breast Cancer Classification Engine

A machine learning system designed to predict tumor malignancy from cellular characteristics, demonstrating **end-to-end data science execution** from raw data to actionable insights.

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Dual-Model Architecture**: Engineered both a custom Naive Bayes classifier and a kernel-based SVM to compare probabilistic and geometric learning approaches
- **Clinical-Grade Data Processing**:
  - Intelligent handling of missing values while preserving data distributions
  - Strategic feature selection based on biomedical relevance
- **Interpretability-First Design**:
  - Transparent probability calculations for medical trust
  - Decision boundary visualization for model auditing

## Technical Sophistication
- Implemented Laplace smoothing to handle rare edge cases
- Developed conditional probability tables from first principles
- Optimized SVM hyperparameters for non-linear separability
- Created dynamic visualization suite for model behavior analysis

## Implementation Highlights
- Pure Python implementation of core ML algorithms
- Scikit-learn integration for production-ready comparisons
- Modular design allowing easy extension to new models
